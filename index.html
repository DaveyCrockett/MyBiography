                I grew up in <strong class="cali">Southern California</strong> as a young adult. I held a few jobs at the time, one being customer service representative at a bowling alley in my area. I left this job to search for better and found myself in a U.S. Navy Recruiters office at the age of twenty. I found the chairs in the office quite <em class="chair">comfortable</em> and the recruiter's voice to be muffled as I ignored what he said. Didn't take long for me to be sitting in that chair and say, <mark>"Where do I sign!"</mark> Next thing I know I was in bootcamp leading to training to be an Aviation Electronics Technician. After training I was flown to the middle of the Arabian Gulf on an aircraft carrier where I soon learned all kinds of skills. After a total of 8 years in the military I seperated to be a student and stay at home father, while also supporting my wife in achieving her degrees. Once I finally found my way back to <strong class="cali">Southern California</strong>, I graduated from a coding bootcamp with a certificate. As I searched for employment I also realized I still had time on my G.I. Bill, a government grant, so here I am trying to add to my portfolio and perfect my new skill.
